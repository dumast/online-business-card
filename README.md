# Online Business Card
*This project's idea comes from my team and I's participation in Hack the Heights 5 hackathon*

## What is it?
This is a fullstack website to regroup all of a person's social medias into one place, just like an online business card. 
To use it, simply put your name (or group name), the links (they have to start with https://www) of your social medias in the corresponding spaces as well as a quick description and press publish.

## Tech Stack
* **ejs** for the frontend
* **express js** for the backend
* **mongodb** for the database

## Requirements
To use this app locally, you need:
* **node**
* **mongodb** (and connect it to the app instead of the environment variable)

## How to install it?
* *-- git clone https://github.com/dumast/online-business-card.git*
* *-- cd online-business-card*
* *-- npm install*
* *-- npm start*

## Where is the app hosted?
The app is currently hosted on Microsoft Azure, but the url is kept private for now
